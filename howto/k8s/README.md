# Hackathon'24 Central API: k8s deployment

In this sub-folder, the manifests for the Central API MVP prototype for k8s are stored.

We used them to create k8s resources through Crossplane, hosted in the Central API cluster.

* Files 01 and 02: providerConfig and Kubernetes "customer" manifest for vanilla Kubernetes
* Files 04 and 05: config and customer manifest for Cluster Stacks requests (partly working, control plane node worked)
